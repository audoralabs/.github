# audoralabs

**AudoraLabs** is an independent product studio focused on building and operating reliable software.

We build our own SaaS products and selectively partner with founders on systems that need to work in production - not just demos.

---

## What we work on

- Real-time systems and event-driven architectures
- Scalable backends and APIs
- Production-grade infrastructure and cloud systems
- End-to-end product engineering, from idea to shipped software

Our work emphasizes **ownership, simplicity, and long-term maintainability**.

## Products

This organization hosts:

- Public and private SaaS products built at AudoraLabs
- Supporting libraries and internal tooling
- Open-source projects shared when they provide real value

Not all work is public.

---

## Philosophy

- Ship working software
- Design for scale early, not later
- Prefer clarity over complexity
- Build things that hold up in real-world usage

AudoraLabs is product-led, engineering-driven, and intentionally small.
